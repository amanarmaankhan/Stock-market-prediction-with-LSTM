# Stock-market-prediction-with-LSTM
This particular project was developed for an internship at Widhya as a final project.

financial asymmetry in stock market is big problem.It creates inequality and other issues like market failure,moral hazard, and monopolies etc.
So, to overcome this issue I have made this LSTM model which would take  all the past information ,create few new columns for analysing and give us a brief idea of the future stock prices.

Firstly I made a basic LSTM model (LSTM-no-TA) ,this would just take the data then analyse it and predict the next data. 
This wasn’t useful for the cause as it didn’t serve any purpose.

I modified it a lot made various logical changes and made a model(LSTM-endgame) which would predict at least a month forward. 
This model is capable of doing its bit for reducing financial asymmetry in the stock market.
